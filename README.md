Overview
This repository contains an implementation of customer segmentation analysis using Python and popular data science libraries. The analysis aims to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior using clustering techniques such as K-means or DBSCAN. The identified segments are then analyzed to understand their characteristics and behaviors.

Steps Covered
Dataset: The analysis uses a retail dataset containing information about customer transactions, demographics, and purchasing behavior. This type of dataset is suitable for understanding customer preferences and patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Before clustering, the dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, scale numerical features if necessary, and encode categorical variables.
Clustering: Two clustering techniques are implemented:
K-means: A centroid-based clustering method that partitions the dataset into K clusters based on similarity.
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): A density-based clustering method that identifies clusters of varying shapes and sizes in the data.
Segment Analysis: Once clusters are identified, each segment's characteristics are analyzed. This includes examining average purchase amounts, frequency of purchases, types of products purchased, and any demographic patterns that differentiate the segments.
Visualization: Visualizations are created to present the results of the segmentation analysis. These may include:
Cluster Centers Plot: Shows the centroids of each cluster in the feature space.
Customer Segments Plot: Visual representation of the identified clusters and their distribution.
Characteristics Comparison: Bar charts or heatmaps comparing segment characteristics.
